Issue:
After importing the PI Example Kit into the AF database, the user may encounter a "Failed to create... was not found" error when 
selecting "Create or Update Data Reference" in order to create PI Points. To resolve this, the User Guide recommends to select
the affected attributes and right mouse click option "Reset To Template". However, this can result in "Calc Failed" being returned
when the user attempts to start the PI Analyses.

Workaround:
The "Calc Failed" issue occurs when the user resets all the attributes on the element to template instead of just the PI Point attributes
that encounter the "Failed to create.." error. This is because some of the static elements which are used as part of some analyses
do not have a default template value. Thus, resetting them to template removes their existing value and leaves a blank value that can not
be used in the analyses and resulting in "Calc Failed".

The solution is to make sure only the PI Point attributes are selecting when resetting them to template. Using attribute search and ordering
by Data Reference type makes it easier to select all PIPoint attributes at once.
